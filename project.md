# Project: Create a Simulation

* Github Classroom Link: [https://classroom.github.com/a/rqUs43F3](https://classroom.github.com/a/rqUs43F3)


## Overview
In this group project, you and one partner will develop a simulation of a natural or real-world phenomenon using Python and the `py5` graphics library. This simulation should model dynamic, rule-based behavior over time and provide insight into the phenomenon.

You’ll follow a **multi-phase process** — proposal, prototype, development, and final presentation — and receive feedback along the way. Your final submission will include a functional simulation, documentation, a brief analysis supported by `matplotlib` charts, and a class presentation.

## Project Objectives
- Model and simulate a dynamic system using techniques covered in class.
- Implement the simulation in Python with `py5` for interactive visuals.
- Analyze system behavior over time with data and `matplotlib` charts.
- Communicate the simulation's purpose, implementation, and findings clearly.

## Example Topics

### Natural Phenomena
- Forest fire spread
- Predator-prey ecosystems
- Diffusion of particles or gas
- Swarm behavior (ants, bees, flocking, schooling)

### Social or Human Systems
- Traffic flow simulation
- Epidemic spread models
- Opinion dynamics
- Resource sharing among agents

### Physical Systems
- Bouncing particles
- Simulated gravity and orbits (e.g. solar system model)
- Simple fluid movement
- Percolation
- BZ reaction

### Other interesting simulations
- Game that includes physics or agent based models
- Artificial life simulation (e.g. [Langton's ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant))
- [Self avoiding random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-avoiding_walk)
- [Lattice gas cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_gas_automaton)
- [Abelian Sandpiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model)
- [Braitenberg Vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle)




## Project Timeline & Phases

### Phase 1: Project Proposal
**Due:** Thursday April 3rd  
**Points:** 10 points

You will submit a 1 page write-up describing your simulation concept. This must be approved before moving to the next phase.

**Deliverable:** A markdown file `proposal.md` describing:
- System or phenomenon being simulated
- Rules, agents, and overall goals
- What the visualization will represent
- Initial ideas for variables and interactivity
- Sketches or example visuals

#### Rubric – Phase 1: Proposal (10 pts)

| **Category** | **Points** |
|----------|--------|
| Clarity of Simulation Goal | 3 |
| Realistic and Scope-Appropriate Concept | 3 |
| Identification of System Elements | 2 |
| Clear Plan for Visual Output | 2 |

### Phase 2: Prototype and Demonstration
**Due:** Thursday April 17th  
**Points:** 20 points

Demonstrate a **prototype** of your simulation and provide a brief overview of your progress in class (5–7 minutes).

**Deliverable:**  
- Working early version of your simulation (some agents or behavior in place)  
- In-class demo  
- Code should show core logic and visuals beginning to work

#### Rubric – Phase 2: Prototype (20 pts)

| **Category** | **Points** |
|----------|--------|
| Basic Functionality (agent movement, visuals) | 8 |
| Code Structure and Use of `py5` | 5 |
| Responsiveness to User Input or Variables | 4 |

### Phase 3: Final Simulation Submission
**Due:** Friday April 25th  
**Points:** 100 points

You will submit your completed simulation, full code, and a brief report with system overview, user guide, and an analysis of behaviors observed. You must include charts/graphs created using `matplotlib` to support your analysis.

**Deliverables:**
- Final Python code and documentation
- 1–2 page documentation:
  - How the simulation works
  - Description of key variables and rules
  - Explanation of parameters and interactivity
  - Observed results or trends
  - **At least one `matplotlib` chart**

#### Rubric – Phase 3: Final Project (100 pts)
