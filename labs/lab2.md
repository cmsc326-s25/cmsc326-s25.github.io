# Lab 2: Vectors

* First read this page then start working through the lab with the GitHub classroom link below.
* Github Classroom Link: [https://classroom.github.com/a/8E2Zqvak](https://classroom.github.com/a/8E2Zqvak)
* Put your answers in directly in the Jupyter notebook provided in the module.

### Objective

Learn about **Euclidean vectors**. A vector is defined as an entity that has both *magnitude* and *direction*. Knowledge of vectors will be important for our future simulations that involve moving an object through a space. 

### Instructions

Clone the GitHub Classroom repository to your local machine and complete `lab2.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. Complete the exercises in the notebook. When you are finished, save your notebook file and commit your changes and push them back to your GitHub Classroom repository.
