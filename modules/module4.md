# Module 4: Simulating Continuous Systems

* First read this page then start working through the lab with the GitHub classroom link below.
* Github Classroom Link: [https://classroom.github.com/a/m8gKAOiG](https://classroom.github.com/a/m8gKAOiG)
* Put your answers directly in the Jupyter notebooks provided in the module.

### Objective

Use simulation to model simple chemical reactions, B-Z reactions, predator-prey models, other continuous systems.

### Instructions

Clone the GitHub Classroom repository to your local machine and complete `module4.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. When you are finished, save your notebook files and commit your changes and push them back to your GitHub Classroom repository. Pushing files back to your GitHub Classroom repositories is how you submit assignments in this class. I will grade the latest push that occurs before the due date.
