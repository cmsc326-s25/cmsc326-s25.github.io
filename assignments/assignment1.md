This assignment has two parts: two small problems in physics. The objective is to apply what you've learned in modules two and three and labs two and three to complete a programming assignment involving simulating physics.


### Instructions

Clone the GitHub Classroom repository to your local machine and complete `assignment1.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. When you are finished, save your notebook files and commit your changes and push them back to your GitHub Classroom repository.
