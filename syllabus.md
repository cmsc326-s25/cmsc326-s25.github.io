## Welcome to Simulation! 

### Course Description 

Thereâ€™s an exciting dimension of computer science that focuses on randomness, uncertainty, and mimicking real-world behaviors. Simulation explores this dimension by teaching you how to model and analyze complex systems using computational simulations. Here, we tackle questions like:
* How can we predict waiting times in a crowded coffee shop or at a busy airport check-in counter? (Queueing systems)
* How can we simulate the behavior of card games or board games? (Monte Carlo methods)
* How do businesses manage inventory to minimize costs while avoiding shortages? (Inventory systems)
* How can we generate random numbers and ensure they behave like true randomness in simulations? (Random number generation)

Unlike traditional algorithms, which often rely on certainty and exact solutions, simulations embrace uncertainty and use statistical methods to approximate reality. We delve into discrete-event simulation, where systems are modeled as a sequence of events over time, and stochastic modeling, which deals with systems influenced by random processes.

This course will introduce you to the mathematics and programming techniques behind these methods, including:
* Statistical concepts for analyzing and interpreting simulation results.
* Techniques for estimating key system parameters, like mean service times or inventory levels.
* Methods for modeling inputs to ensure simulations reflect real-world behavior.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, you will:

* Understand the key concepts of simulation, including discrete-event simulation, Monte Carlo simulation, and stochastic modeling.
* Identify scenarios where simulation techniques are appropriate for solving complex problems.
* Design, implement, and analyze discrete-event simulations for systems involving queuing, inventory management, and other processes.
* Develop Monte Carlo simulations to estimate probabilities, model random processes, and solve optimization problems.
* Apply elementary statistics to analyze simulation outputs.
* Write simulation programs using the Python programming language and libraries.
* Model real-world systems using appropriate input data and assumptions.

## Coursework and Grading

### Course Work
- Module exercises
- Programming Assignments 
- Lab assignments
- Team project
- Project presentation

### Grading Breakdown
   * 30%: Modules exercises
   * 20%: Programming Assignments (4 x 5% each)
   * 25%: Labs
   * 20%: Team Project
   *  5%: Project presentation 
   
### Attendance Policy
Regular attendance for the entire class time is expected. You should not miss more than 4 total sessions (including lecture and lab). If you have to quarantine due to COVID or miss class for other legitimate reasons you will not be penalized.

### Late Work Policy

Assignments including modules and labs may be submitted late with a **10%** deduction **per day** late.  

You will have two "**late passes**" per semester to use on modules and labs.  To use a late pass, notify me which assignment you would like to use it on, and you may turn that assignment in **one week late for full credit**. 

Late passes may **not** be used on the final project.   

In cases of personal illnesses, emergencies, or documented accommodations, assignments may be submitted late for full credit if you notify me of your situation. 

### Self-Guided Module exercises

Each lecture will be accompanied by a *self-guided worksheet*. This module exercise is to complement in-class content and to assist you in reviewing the material. In-class module exercises are due one week from the lecture in which they are assigned. 

### Labs

Labs are short-to-medium size hands-on computer security assignments that are designed to reinforce lecture. This course has a formal laboratory component. You are expected to attend each lab for the entire 50 minute lab period. Some labs may require that you work in teams of two or more. Almost all labs will require more than the 50 minute alloted time to complete, so please expect to have to spend extra time on the labs.

Labs are due at 11:59 pm on the night prior to the next lab (for this course, that means 11:59 pm Thursday evening), unless I explicitly provide a different deadline. Note that some labs are more extensive, so might require two weeks to complete. In that case I will explicitly inform you of this. 
 
### Class Project and Presentation

You will work on a class project of your own choice. You will work in groups of 2 for the project. You will be required to turn in both your code and a short write-up describing the design and implementation of your project, and to make a short in-class presentation about your work. 

## Class Communication

I will use two primary forms of communication in this class: email announcements and Slack. You are responsible for remaining up to date on any information sent by email or posted to Slack. This may include clarifications to assignments, updates on grading rubrics, and changes in office hours. 

For all general course information, questions, and clarifications, please use Slack. I hope that the Slack workspace can be an extension of our classroom community where we can share questions and answers for the entire class to view and learn from.

If you have personal, individual issues you'd like addressed, you should send those by email to me. However, all course related topics should be directed to Slack.


## Course Policies

### Illness policy

If you are ill and it will cause you to miss class, lab, or an assignment, you should let me know in advance, if possible. It is your responsibility to catch up with any missed material if you are able to do so.  If not, then immediately on return, work out a time-frame with me on when work will be submitted. 


### Academic Integrity policy

It is very important in this course (and in life), that your work be your own. These guidelines will help you achieve that.

You must:

- Do your best to solve all homework, projects, labs, and exams on your own.
- Write the names of any students you collaborated with as a comment at the top of your file (subject to the constraints below).

You may:

- Discuss general approaches to solving the homework problems with other students, but the pen-to-paper, fingers-to-keyboard work should be your own. 
- Have another student look at a specific snippet of your code (e.g., 10 lines) to help you debug a programming error.

You may not:

- Copy code to or from other students or people outside of the class.
- Have someone else write code for you.
- Copy code from the internet, unless you specifically reference the source and can explain how it works. This should be a tiny minority of the code you submit.
- Write code as a group and then submit identical or slightly modified versions---if you discuss general approaches to solving a problem together, you still must be writing up your own independent solution.

The [Honor Code](https://studentdevelopment.richmond.edu/student-handbook/honor/Honor-Code-January-2023.pdf) will apply to this course. Please read through the code carefully.



### Generative AI

You will almost certainly be using generative AI in some way for the rest of your career. You may use generative AI tools for homework, labs, and project in the following manner.

You must: 
- Understand any code that you use. We reserve the right to review your submitted code with you, and ask you to explain how it works. 

You may:
- Ask a GenAI tool a generic question for informational purposes. For example, "Please explain the C++ syntax for reading input from a file, and give an example."  If you use this code, please cite the source in a comment.

You may not:
- Ask a GenAI tool to solve the assignment.  For example, you should not paste the entire problem description and ask the GenAI to solve it for you.
- No GenAI tools can be used for the exams.

This policy is subject to change as we all learn more about how GenAI works and doesnâ€™t work as part of learning college level course content.



### Disability Services 

Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact [Disability Services](https://disability.richmond.edu/) (or call 804-662-5001) to establish eligibility and to coordinate reasonable accommodations. 

If you are approved for classroom and/or testing accommodation(s) please make sure to submit a Disability Accommodation Notice to me at this [link](https://disabilityportal.richmond.edu/ClockWork/user/selfregC/courses.aspx).


## Wellness

If any issue arises that may limit your ability to participate in class, for example, personal illness, family emergency, etc., please be sure to discuss these matters with me as soon as possible and accommodations will be made available to you as appropriate.

Feelings of being overwhelmed are unfortunately quite common in the university environment. You are not alone, and there are a number of resources available to provide support in those moments. Learning to ask for help is an important part of the university experience, and if you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings of anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. UR offers counseling services, and also consider reaching out to a friend, family or faculty member you trust for help.
